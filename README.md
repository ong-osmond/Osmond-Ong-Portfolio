CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Welcome to Homework2 where I start to develop my website.

### The website contains three (3) sections:
1. About Me (Home / Index)
2. Portfolio
3. Contact

### Features:
1. Bootstrap is used for styling and page behaviours. 
2. A Navbar with branding is fixed at the top of the page. The Navbar collapses if the screen size is small.
3. Content is responsive. (The name="viewport" in the meta tag enables this feature.)
4. There are links to external pages and social media. 
5. A Footer is fixed to the bottom of the page.
